In recent years deceptive news articles are becoming dangerous prospects for online users, and with most of the news being published as online articles, it is becoming difficult to track the origin and validate information based on the source. Using fake news for political and economic gain is a rising trend in online articles. Presently, two ways are dominating in the detection of fake news. The first approach is to use human analysts as fact-checkers and is limited to analyst’s knowledge to detect misinformation, the second is to use machine learning-based natural learning processing to detect fake news. In this project, three machine learning based models were compared using Kaggle’s Fake News dataset and evaluated against their performance to distinguish the articles. The Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is used in this project as a Transformer based machine learning algorithm, Logistic Regression based Classifier is used as a baseline model and paired with Random forest as Ensemble learning method. Logistic Regression based classifier is selected as the final model for its low requirement of training time and computation resources with a higher recall score.
